# Titomachine is a TTK-91 Emulator
[![CI](https://github.com/sevonj/titomachine/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sevonj/titomachine/actions/workflows/main.yml)  
Because my programs were too much for [Titokone](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/titokone/).

> [!WARNING]  
> This application is work in progress.

> [!NOTE]  
> The codebase is currently undergoing some renovation.
>  - Unfinished and broken features, such as interrupts will be either fixed or ripped out from master.
>  - At least the emulator side will be covered by rustdoc. (Example: [devices module](https://sevonj.github.io/titomachine/titomachine/emulator/devices/index.html))
>  - User docs with hugo
>  - Unit tests will be brought to a proper standard.
