TTK-91 Emulator

Because [this](https://gist.github.com/sevonj/9e10a2ff824b5348ae5d32048b7fb38d) was too much for the original TitoKone.

The actual emulator code can be found at [Titolib](https://github.com/sevonj/titolib).

### Notes:
- You still need to compile the files with [titokone](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/titokone/).
- Instructions may and probably will fail silently.
- Only working syscall is =halt.
- Bit operations are not implemented: AND, OR, XOR, SHL, SHR, NOT, SHRA.
